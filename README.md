# ML Model on FPGA Eklavya23
An ML model will be implemented on an FPGA, specifically targeting the MNIST dataset. This model will inherently be accelerated on the FPGA.

##Introduction
The aim of this project was to create a Convolutional Neural Network(_basically a machine learning model_) to accurately detect any number between 0-9 from the MNIST dataset.The MNIST(_Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology_) dataset is a large collection of images of hanndwritten digits.This Neural Network was then to be implemented on an FPGA using Verilog HDL .

## Testing code
For testing Verilog code ,EDA Playground or Quartus/Vivado is required.
